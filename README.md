"will this fit?‚Äù is a Chrome extension designed to revolutionize the online shopping experience by addressing one of the most common uncertainties shoppers face: size fit. By integrating directly into your browser, this extension offers a seamless way for users to determine if the clothing articles they are interested in will fit them based on their personal size preferences and known fits from other brands.
